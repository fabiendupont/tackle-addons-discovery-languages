Tackle Add-ons - Discovery - Languages
---

This add-on explores the source code repository and finds the languages using [GitHub Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist). It's common that multiple languages are found, because the project provides a Makefile, a Dockerfile, or any other helper for building and shipping. They usually represent a minority and the main language percentage will be the highest. The add-on sorts the languages by their percentage and tags the application with the most represented language.
